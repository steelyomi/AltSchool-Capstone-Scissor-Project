Brief is the new black, this is what inspires the team at Scissor. In today’s world, it’s important to
keep things as short as possible, and this applies to more concepts than you may realize. From
music, speeches, to wedding receptions, brief is the new black. Scissor is a simple tool which
makes URLs as short as possible. Scissor thinks it can disrupt the URL shortening industry and
give the likes of bit.ly and ow.ly a run for their money within 2 years.

## URL Shortening:

Scissor allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the Scissor platform and a
shorter URL gets automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as
possible, making it easy to share on social media or through other channels.

## Custom URLs:

Scissor also allows users to customize their shortened URLs. Users can choose their own
custom domain name and customize the URL to reflect their brand or content. This feature is
particularly useful for individuals or small businesses who want to create branded links for their
content.

## Analytics:

Scissor provides basic analytics that allow users to track their shortened URL's performance.
Users can see how many clicks their shortened URL has received and where the clicks are
coming from. This feature will be implemented using Firebase's built-in analytics feature.
